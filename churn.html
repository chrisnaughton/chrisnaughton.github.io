            <p>This project dives into the big challenge of customer churn in the telecom world. My main goal was to build a smart model that not only predicts which customers might leave but also helps us understand *why* they're leaving or staying. This way, we can create better strategies to keep them around. I used the "Telco customer churn: IBM dataset," which is a public dataset available on Kaggle.</p>

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>For any company with subscriptions, knowing why customers cancel (churn) is super important for future revenue and growth. This project tackles that head-on by building a solid prediction model for customer churn in a telecom setting. I wanted to do more than just accurately forecast churn; I aimed to pinpoint the key reasons customers stick around or leave, so we can develop targeted plans to help them stay.</p>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>My project followed a few key steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Preparation:</strong> First, I cleaned up the data, filled in any missing bits, and made sure all the data types were correct.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> This was a crucial part where I turned existing data into more useful insights. This included:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Grouping continuous variables: For example, categorizing customer ages (like '25-39', '40-54') and how long they've been a customer (like 'under 1 year', '1-3 years').</li>
                        <li>Creating new features: I developed things like a <code>Services_Count</code> (how many core services they use) and an <strong>interaction term</strong> to see how, say, a customer's time with us affects those on a month-to-month contract.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Model Development:</strong> I built a <strong>Logistic Regression</strong> model to predict churn. I chose this model because it's great for understanding *why* certain predictions are made.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Importance Analysis:</strong> After building the model, I dug into its results to clearly see which factors had the biggest impact on customers churning or staying.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Key Findings & Outcome</h2>
            <p>The Logistic Regression model I developed turned out to be really effective, hitting an impressive <strong>98.5% overall accuracy</strong>. It was particularly good at identifying customers who would churn, with <strong>100% precision</strong> (meaning almost every customer it predicted would leave actually did) and <strong>98% recall</strong> (it caught almost all of the customers who actually churned).</p>

            <h3>Key Factors Driving Customer Churn:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Month-to-Month Contracts:</strong> Customers on these contracts are highly likely to churn, and this risk actually grows the longer they stay on this flexible plan.</li>
                <li><strong>High Monthly Charges:</strong> A strong sign that a customer might leave, possibly because they feel they're paying too much or not getting enough value.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Tech Support:</strong> Customers without technical support are significantly more likely to churn, showing how important good customer help is.</li>
                <li><strong>New Customers (Under 1 Year Tenure):</strong> This group naturally has a higher churn risk, so it's vital to engage with them proactively early on.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Factors Driving Customer Retention:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tech Support Subscriptions:</strong> Customers who pay for technical support tend to stick around much longer.</li>
                <li><strong>Longer-Term Contracts (One-Year/Two-Year):</strong> These contracts offer a lot of stability and really help reduce churn compared to month-to-month options.</li>
                <li><strong>Mid-to-Long Term Tenure:</strong> Customers who've been with us for 1-3 years or more show strong loyalty and are less likely to churn over time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Additional Finding: The Internet Service Puzzle</h2>
            <p>Beyond the main churn drivers, I found something interesting about <strong>Internet Service Type</strong>.</p>
            <p>While customers who *only* have our phone service (no internet through us) are more likely to stay, those who *do* have our internet service (both Fiber Optic and DSL) actually show a slightly increased risk of churning. This is a bit unexpected! It suggests that these customers might be finding better or cheaper internet options elsewhere, making our internet service a key area to look at for competitive analysis and to re-evaluate its value to customers.</p>

            <h2>Recommendations</h2>
            <p>Based on these insights, I'd suggest the telecom company:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Focus on Month-to-Month Customers:</strong> Start proactive campaigns to retain month-to-month customers, especially once they hit the 6-12 month mark. Highlight the benefits of longer contracts and offer special incentives.</li>
                <li><strong>Boost Tech Support & Contract Sales:</strong> More actively promote the value of Tech Support and the advantages of one-year and two-year contract options.</li>
                <li><strong>Investigate Internet Service:</strong> Dig deeper into customer satisfaction with current internet services and compare our offerings with competitors' pricing and reliability. If internet service is indeed a churn trigger, it likely points to external market pressures or perceived service gaps.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Python:</strong> Programming Language</li>
                <li><strong>Pandas:</strong> Data manipulation and analysis</li>
                <li><strong>NumPy:</strong> Numerical computing</li>
                <li><strong>Scikit-learn:</strong> Machine learning model development (Logistic Regression, preprocessing)</li>
                <li><strong>Matplotlib:</strong> Data visualization</li>
                <li><strong>Seaborn:</strong> Enhanced data visualization</li>
            </ul>
