            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>For any subscription-based company, understanding why customers leave (churn) is paramount to future revenue and growth. This project addresses that critical challenge by developing a robust predictive model for customer churn within a telecom context. My goal was to not only accurately forecast churn but also to identify the key factors driving customer retention and attrition, enabling the development of targeted intervention strategies.</p>
            <p>The analysis utilizes the "Customer Churn Prediction: Analysis," a synthetic dataset available on Kaggle.</p>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>The project workflow encompassed several key stages:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Preparation:</strong> Initial steps involved addressing missing values, converting data types, and ensuring overall data cleanliness.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> This crucial phase involved transforming existing data into more insightful features. This included:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Grouping continuous variables:</strong> Categorizing customer age (e.g., into '25-39', '40-54' etc.) and tenure (e.g., 'under 1 year', '1-3 years') into distinct groups.</li>
                        <li><strong>Creating composite features:</strong> Developing variables like <code>Services_Count</code> (total core services subscribed to) and an <strong>interaction term</strong> (e.g., to understand how customer tenure specifically impacts those on a month-to-month contract).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Model Development:</strong> A <strong>Logistic Regression</strong> model was built for churn prediction, chosen for its strong interpretability.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Importance Analysis:</strong> Post-modeling, the model's coefficients were analyzed to quantitatively identify the most influential drivers of churn and retention.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Key Findings & Outcome</h2>
            <p>The developed Logistic Regression model proved to be highly effective, achieving <strong>98.5% overall accuracy</strong>. Its performance in identifying churners was exceptional, with <strong>100% precision</strong> (meaning nearly all predicted churners actually churned) and 98% recall (correctly identifying almost all actual churners).</p>

            <h3>Key Features Driving Customer Churn:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Month-to-Month Contracts:</strong> Customers on these contracts are highly prone to churn. This risk intensifies the longer they remain on this flexible plan, indicating a compounding effect of contract type and tenure.</li>
                <li><strong>High Monthly Charges:</strong> A strong indicator of churn, suggesting potential price sensitivity or a perceived lack of value for the services received.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Tech Support:</strong> Customers without technical support services are significantly more likely to churn, underscoring the importance of robust customer assistance.</li>
                <li><strong>New Customers (Under 1 Year Tenure):</strong> This group exhibits a higher inherent churn risk, highlighting the critical need for proactive engagement during the initial customer lifecycle phase.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Features Driving Customer Retention:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tech Support Subscriptions:</strong> Customers actively subscribing to technical support demonstrate significantly higher retention rates.</li>
                <li><strong>Longer-Term Contracts (One-Year/Two-Year):</strong> These contract types provide substantial stability and effectively reduce churn compared to month-to-month options.</li>
                <li><strong>Mid-to-Long Term Tenure:</strong> Customers who have stayed for 1-3 years or over 3 years exhibit strong loyalty, becoming less likely to churn over time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Additional Finding: The Nuance of Internet Service</h2>
            <p>Beyond the primary churn drivers, an intriguing pattern emerged concerning <strong>Internet Service Type</strong>.</p>
            <p>While customers who <em>only</em> subscribe to our phone service (i.e., no internet service through us) show a higher propensity to stay, customers <em>with</em> any form of our internet service (including both Fiber Optic and DSL) exhibit a minor increased churn risk. This counter-intuitive finding is significant: it suggests customers might be finding more reliable or cheaper internet options elsewhere, making this a critical area for competitive analysis and re-evaluation of our internet service's value proposition.</p>

            <h2>Recommendations</h2>
            <p>Based on these insights, I would advise the telecom company to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Target Month-to-Month Customers:</strong> Implement proactive retention campaigns for month-to-month customers, especially as they approach the 6-12 month mark. Highlight long-term contract benefits and exclusive incentives.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhance Tech Support & Contract Promotion:</strong> More aggressively promote the value and benefits of Tech Support subscriptions and longer-term contract options (One-Year, Two-Year).</li>
                <li><strong>Investigate Internet Service Competitiveness:</strong> Conduct a deeper analysis into customer satisfaction with current internet services and competitor pricing/reliability. If internet service is indeed a churn driver, it likely points to external market pressures or perceived service gaps.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Python:</strong> Programming Language</li>
                <li><strong>Pandas:</strong> Data manipulation and analysis</li>
                <li><strong>NumPy:</strong> Numerical computing</li>
                <li><strong>Scikit-learn:</strong> Machine learning model development (Logistic Regression, preprocessing)</li>
                <li><strong>Matplotlib:</strong> Data visualization</li>
                <li><strong>Seaborn:</strong> Enhanced data visualization</li>
            </ul>
