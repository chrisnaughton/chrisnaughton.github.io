            <p>This project aims to uncover critical insights into sales performance, profit drivers, and customer behavior in a dataset for a fictional Super Store in the early 2010's.
                It uses the "Global Superstore Dataset" from Kaggle.
                Please feel free to explore the interactive dashboards below:</p>

            <h2>Dashboard 1: Executive Overview & Business Health</h2>
            <div class="dashboard-talking-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>This dashboard provides our <strong>executive overview</strong>: from 2011-2014, we generated <strong>$12.6 million in sales</strong> and <strong>$1.47 million in profit</strong>, with a <strong>12% overall gross profit margin</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Observe the <strong>quarterly sales and profit trends</strong>. Despite nearly 100% sales growth over 4 years, our profit margin remained stable, indicating a need to focus on efficiency for proportional profit growth.</li>
                    <li>The segment breakdown shows the <strong>Consumer segment drives most sales</strong>, followed by Corporate, with Home Office sales less than half of Corporate.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Dashboard 2: Discount Impact & Transactional Loss</h2>
            <div class="dashboard-talking-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>This dashboard highlights <b>where we're losing money</b>, driven by discounts. See our <b>top loss-leading products</b> like "Tables" and "Machines."</li>
                    <li><strong>Tables are a major loss leader</strong>, with negative profit margin worsening from -5.1% (2012) to -12.5% (2014), largely due to <b>excessive 70-80% discounts</b> on items like "Lesro Training Table."</li>
                    <li>Even in profitable categories like Binders, we see <b>profit margin erosion</b>: many individual transactions are highly unprofitable (-50% to -200% margins) due to extreme 70-80% discounts on multiple units, e.g., "GBC DocuBind P400 Electric Binding System." Volume isn't consistently translating to profit.</li>
                    <li>The histogram confirms <b>extreme discounts consistently lead to unprofitable transactions</b>, and the heatmap pinpoints <b>"hotspots" for immediate discount practice review</b>.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Dashboard 3: Geographic Performance & Profitability</h2>
            <div class="dashboard-talking-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>This dashboard reveals our <b>geographic wins and losses</b>. The bar chart highlights consistent loss-leading countries/regions like the <b>Dominican Republic, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, and Uganda</b>, primarily due to large discounts exceeding margins.</li>
                    <li>The global profit map quickly visualizes <b>profitability worldwide</b>, showing our strongest and weakest markets.</li>
                    <li>Many highly unprofitable individual sales, especially for "Binder" products with 0.7 or 0.8 discounts (e.g., "GBC Ibimaster 500 Manual ProClick Binding System"), originate from <b>specific US regions (Central and South), Nigeria, and Sweden</b>. This confirms widespread discount misuse across geographies.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Dashboard 4: Strategic Opportunities & Overall Trends</h2>
            <div class="dashboard-talking-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>This dashboard identifies <b>strategic opportunities and overall trends</b>. Our <b>highest performing sub-categories by profit</b> include "Paper" (exceptionally profitable) and "Copiers" (e.g., "Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier") and "Phones" within Technology.</li>
                    <li>The pie chart shows our <b>profit vs. loss ratio</b>, highlighting the proportion of items selling profitably. The breakdown of loss-making items by sub-category pinpoints specific attention areas.</li>
                    <li>The sales by month line graph reveals <b>clear seasonal patterns</b>, consistently peaking in Q4 (Oct-Dec) with a Q1 dip, crucial for planning.</li>
                    <li>Our <b>Average Lifetime Profit Per Customer is approximately $922.93</b>. While Consumer sales are high, their AOV is declining. Conversely, Home Office shows strong AOV growth, a key area for targeted engagement.</li>
