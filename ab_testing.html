        <h1>A/B/C Testing Analysis: Fast-Food Promotion Effectiveness</h1>
        <p>This project analyzes the effectiveness of three distinct promotional strategies implemented by a fast-food chain using A/B/C testing methodology.</p>

            <a href="./Fast_Food_A-B_Testing/" target="_blank">View Project Code on GitHub</a>
            </div>

        <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Assess Statistical Significance:</strong> Determine if there are statistically significant differences in total sales performance among the three promotions.</li>
            <li><strong>Identify Best Performers:</strong> Pinpoint which specific promotions perform better or worse than others.</li>
            <li><strong>Provide Actionable Recommendations:</strong> Offer data-backed guidance for the fast-food chain's promotional strategy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Dataset</h2>
        <p>The analysis uses simulated sales data from a multi-week promotional campaign across various fast-food store locations. Key variables include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>MarketID</code> and <code>LocationID</code>: Identifiers for markets and individual stores.</li>
            <li><code>MarketSize</code>: Categorical classification of the market (Small, Medium, Large).</li>
            <li><code>AgeOfStore</code>: Store age in years.</li>
            <li><code>Promotion</code>: The specific promotion assigned to the store (1, 2, or 3).</li>
            <li><code>SalesInThousands</code>: Weekly sales, which was aggregated to <strong>Total Sales per Location</strong> as the primary outcome metric.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Weekly sales data was aggregated to <code>Total Sales per Location</code> to represent each store as a single experimental unit.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Visualizations (e.g., box plots) were used to understand sales distributions across promotion groups. Covariate balance checks were performed on <code>MarketSize</code> and <code>AgeOfStore</code> to ensure fair comparisons between groups.</li>
            <li><strong>Statistical Hypothesis Testing:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):</strong> An ANOVA test was conducted to determine if there was an overall statistically significant difference in mean total sales among the three promotion groups.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tukey's HSD Post-Hoc Test:</strong> Since ANOVA indicated an overall significant difference, <strong>Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test</strong> was used for pairwise comparisons between promotions, controlling the family-wise error rate.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <p>The statistical analysis revealed clear differences in promotional effectiveness:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Overall Significance:</strong> The ANOVA test showed a <strong>statistically significant difference</strong> in total sales among the three promotions (p-value &lt; 0.05), indicating that the promotion choice does impact sales.</li>
            <li><strong>Promotion 2 Underperforms:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Promotion 1 generated approximately **$43,078 more** in total sales per location than Promotion 2, a **statistically significant** difference (p &lt; 0.05).</li>
                    <li>Promotion 3 generated approximately **$32,140 more** in total sales per location than Promotion 2, also a **statistically significant** difference (p &lt; 0.05).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Promotion 1 and Promotion 3 are Similar:</strong> There was **no statistically significant difference** in total sales between Promotion 1 and Promotion 3 (p &gt; 0.05). Both performed similarly well.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Based on these findings, we recommend:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Discontinue Promotion 2:** This promotion consistently leads to significantly lower sales and should be **avoided** in future campaigns.</li>
            <li>**Focus on Promotions 1 and 3:** Both Promotion 1 and Promotion 3 are effective in driving sales. The choice between these two should be guided by other business considerations, such as implementation cost, operational complexity, or long-term strategic goals, as their sales performance is statistically comparable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>**No Cost Data:** This analysis focused solely on sales volume and did not account for the **cost of implementing each promotion**. A promotion with slightly lower sales but significantly lower costs might still be more profitable.</li>
            <li>**Short Duration:** The sales data covers only four weeks, limiting insights into **long-term effects**, customer loyalty, or sustained promotional impact.</li>
            <li>**External Factors:** Unmeasured external variables (e.g., local events, competitor activities, seasonality) may have influenced sales and were not controlled for.</li>
            <li>**Covariate Balance:** A slight imbalance in `MarketSize` distribution across promotion groups was observed, which could potentially confound results in more complex analyses.</li>
            <li>**Generalizability:** Findings are based on the provided sample and might not perfectly apply to all store locations or future campaigns without further validation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Future Work</h2>
        <p>To enhance this analysis and provide more robust recommendations, consider:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Integrate promotional cost data to determine the **Return on Investment (ROI)** for each strategy.</li>
            <li>**Longer-Term Tracking:** Conduct A/B tests over extended periods (e.g., 8-12 weeks) to assess sustained impact and customer behavior.</li>
            <li>**Advanced Statistical Modeling:** Utilize techniques like ANCOVA or mixed-effects models to explicitly control for confounding variables.</li>
            <li>**Qualitative Feedback:** Collect insights from store managers and customers regarding operational challenges and promotion appeal.</li>
            <li>**Targeted A/B Test (P1 vs. P3):** If needed, design a dedicated, larger-scale A/B test specifically comparing Promotion 1 and Promotion 3 to potentially uncover smaller, subtle differences.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>**Python**</li>
            <li>**Pandas** (for data manipulation)</li>
            <li>**NumPy** (for numerical operations)</li>
            <li>**SciPy** (for statistical tests)</li>
            <li>**Statsmodels** (for ANOVA and Tukey HSD)</li>
            <li>**Matplotlib** (for visualizations)</li>
            <li>**Seaborn** (for enhanced visualizations)</li>
            <li>**Jupyter Notebook** (for reproducible analysis)</li>
        </ul>
