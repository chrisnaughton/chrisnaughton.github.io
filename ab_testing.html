            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project dives into the effectiveness of three different promotional strategies used by a fast-food chain, all tested through an A/B/C methodology. We used the "Fast Food Marketing Campaign A/B Test" dataset, which is available on Kaggle.</p>

            <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Assess Significance:</strong> See if the total sales performance among the three promotions shows a statistically meaningful difference.</li>
                <li><strong>Identify Top Performers:</strong> Figure out which promotions worked best, and which didn't.</li>
                <li><strong>Actionable Advice:</strong> Provide clear, data-driven recommendations for the fast-food chain's future promotions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Dataset</h2>
            <p>The analysis uses simulated sales data from a multi-week promotional campaign across various fast-food store locations. Key variables include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>MarketID</code> and <code>LocationID</code>: Unique codes for markets and individual stores.</li>
                <li><code>MarketSize</code>: How big the market is (Small, Medium, Large).</li>
                <li><code>AgeOfStore</code>: How old the store is in years.</li>
                <li><code>Promotion</code>: Which promotion the store received (1, 2, or 3).</li>
                <li><code>SalesInThousands</code>: Weekly sales figures, which I grouped into <strong>Total Sales per Location</strong> to measure the main outcome.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> I combined weekly sales data into <code>Total Sales per Location</code>, treating each store as a single unit for the experiment.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> I used visualizations like box plots to understand how sales were distributed across different promotions. I also checked <code>MarketSize</code> and <code>AgeOfStore</code> to ensure the groups were balanced for fair comparisons.</li>
                <li><strong>Statistical Hypothesis Testing:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):</strong> I ran an ANOVA test to see if there was a statistically significant difference in average total sales across the three promotions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tukey's HSD Post-Hoc Test:</strong> Since ANOVA showed an overall difference, I used Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test for detailed, pairwise comparisons between promotions, making sure to control for overall error.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <p>The statistical analysis revealed clear differences in promotional effectiveness:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overall Impact:</strong> The ANOVA test confirmed that the choice of promotion significantly impacts total sales (p-value &lt; 0.05).</li>
                <li><strong>Promotion 2 Underperformed:</strong> Promotion 1 brought in about <strong>$43,078 more</strong> in sales per location than Promotion 2 (a statistically significant difference, p &lt; 0.05). Promotion 3 also outperformed Promotion 2 by roughly <strong>$32,140</strong> (p &lt; 0.05).</li>
                <li><strong>Promotions 1 & 3 Similar:</strong> There was no significant difference in total sales between Promotion 1 and Promotion 3 (p &gt; 0.05); both performed equally well.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Recommendations</h2>
            <p>Based on these findings, I'd suggest the fast-food company:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Drop Promotion 2:</strong> This promotion consistently resulted in much lower sales, so it should be stopped for future campaigns.</li>
                <li><strong>Prioritize Promotions 1 and 3:</strong> Both are effective and statistically similar in driving sales. The final choice between them can depend on other factors like cost or how easy they are to run.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Missing Cost Data:</strong> We couldn't do a full ROI analysis without cost data for each promotion.</li>
                <li><strong>Short Study Period:</strong> The 4-week sales data limits our understanding of long-term effects.</li>
                <li><strong>Uncontrolled External Factors:</strong> Things like local events or competitor actions weren't accounted for.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Size Imbalance:</strong> A small imbalance in <code>MarketSize</code> across groups might slightly affect the results.</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Generalizability:</strong> These findings might not perfectly apply to all stores or future campaigns without more testing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Future Work</h2>
            <p>To enhance this analysis and provide more robust recommendations, consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cost-Benefit Analysis:</strong> Add promotional cost data to calculate the <strong>Return on Investment (ROI)</strong> for each strategy.</li>
                <li><strong>Longer-Term Tests:</strong> Run A/B tests for longer (e.g., 8-12 weeks) to see sustained impact and customer behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced Modeling:</strong> Use techniques like ANCOVA or mixed-effects models to better control for other variables.</li>
                <li><strong>Qualitative Feedback:</strong> Gather insights from store managers and customers about operational challenges and promotion appeal.</li>
                <li><strong>Targeted A/B Test (P1 vs. P3):</strong> If needed, run a larger A/B test specifically comparing Promotion 1 and Promotion 3 to find subtle differences.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Python</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Pandas:</strong> For data manipulation.</li>
                <li><strong>NumPy:</strong> For numerical operations.</li>
                <li><strong>SciPy:</strong> For statistical tests.</li>
                <li><strong>Statsmodels:</strong> For ANOVA and Tukey HSD.</li>
                <li><strong>Matplotlib:</strong> For data visualizations.</li>
                <li><strong>Seaborn:</strong> For enhanced visualizations.</li>
                <li><strong>Jupyter Notebook:</strong> For reproducible analysis.</li>
            </ul>
